# Alex-The-Analyst-Bootcamp
This repository contains all the portfolio projects I made while completing Alex The Analyst's Bootcamp on YouTube.

Excel
For the Excel Full Project, I created a dashboard on bike sales and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on creating a different or expanding on this dashboard to test my skills in the future.



Power BI
For Power BI, I created a dashboard to analyse data on Data Professional Survey collected by Alex and below is the output. I plan to make use Power BI again to make my own visualisations and dashboard.

For the Tableau Full Project, I created a dashboard on 2016 Seattle Airbnb data and you can see the output below for reference. I plan to work on using a different dataset to visualise data in Tableau in the future.
